# Setting Up and Running A React Project

#### This guide explanins how to set up and run a React project on your local computer, starting from the installation of Node.js

## Requirements 
- Node.js
- npm (Comes with Node.js)
- Git (Optional, needed if you're pulling the project from a Git repository)

# Steps

### 1. Installing Node.js
   
##### You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system for React projects. Follow these steps to install Node.js:

###### 1. Go to the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
###### 2. Download the version suitable for your operating system (prefer the LTS version).
###### 3. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to complete the installation

#### Verifying Node.js Installation
##### Open the terminal and run the following commands to check the versions:

```bash
  node -v
  npm- v
```

### 2. Cloning an Existing React Project
   
##### If you're cloning an existing project, run the following command in the terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alevyldrm/blogfrontend.git
  cd blogfrontend
```

### 3. Installing Project Dependencies
   
##### After creating or cloning the project, you need to install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
  npm install
```
##### This command will download and install all the required packages into the node_modules folder.

### 4. Running the React Project
   
##### Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

```bash
  npm start
```
##### This command starts a local development server, usually running the project on   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) You can open this address in your browser to view your application.

### 5. Building for Production
   
##### When your app is ready for production, you can create an optimized build by running the following command:

```bash
  npm run build
```
##### This command will generate an optimized and minified build in the build folder.
